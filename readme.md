# Open Exoplanet Catalogue To CSV Table

This script uses the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue Python Interface](https://github.com/ryanvarley/open-exoplanet-catalogue-python) to create a table of values from the catalogue into the format needed by another program. This script is specific to a spreadsheet model but is released here as an example of how to use the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue Python Interface](https://github.com/ryanvarley/open-exoplanet-catalogue-python) to reformat the catalogue data and rescale values.
